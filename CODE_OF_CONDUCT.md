# IVOA Code of Conduct
(Approved by the IVOA Exec on Feb. 18, 2020)

It is the policy of the IVOA that its members and all participants in IVOA activities should experience an environment that is free from harassment.
We want to promote a diverse and inclusive environment with respectful and courteous behaviour and therefore we expect all participants to adhere to the following guidelines:

* Behave professionally. Refrain from harassment in any form, including: sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact or intimidation; potentially offensive comments related to for example: age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, nationality, politics or religion.
* Ensure that all communications are appropriate for a professional audience that may include people with different backgrounds. Sexual or sexist language and imagery are never appropriate.
* Be considerate and respectful to others.
* Critique ideas, not people.

This code of conduct applies to all IVOA community interactions online and offline, including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.

Because of the wide international nature of the IVOA, it is important to realize that behaviour and language that are welcome/acceptable in one particular cultural environment may be unwelcome/offensive in another.
Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others.

Anyone who witnesses a deviation from these guidelines is asked to communicate confidentially to the Chair or Vice Chair or any member of the IVOA Executive Committee.
The IVOA Executive will take the necessary corrective measures.

We thank you for helping us to make the IVOA a welcoming, diverse and respectful environment for all.
